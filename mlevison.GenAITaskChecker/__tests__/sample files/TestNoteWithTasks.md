### Other things that are part of standard themes
With both **bold** and _italic_ text, and a ***combination***.
From v3.9.4 we can now have ==some nicer highlighting== or ~~strikethrough~~ around things. Even ~underlining~ _if we must_.
- #test #tags and @mentions are highlighted (very slightly differently) and have their links turned off
- here's `some inline code` and body text

> Every disease that submits to a cure shall be cured: but we will not call blue yellow to please those who insist on still having jaundice, nor make a midden of the worldâ€™s garden for the sake of some who cannot abide the smell of roses.â€™ -- C. S. Lewis (The Great Divorce)
- Bullets go like this
	- and then this
Frontmatter like fields: look like this.

### Markdown Links
The markdown syntax in Markdown links gets hidden, but appear when cursor is in the link: [NotePlan website](https://noteplan.co/).
### Note Links
- Standard Note links are shown without the surrounding brackets: [[Blank Header TEST]]
- Arrow note links are shown as above, but with a slightly different background colour. e.g. >Blank Header TEST<. They avoid the back-reference showing in that page's References section. (See also [How to create a link without a backlink?](https://help.noteplan.co/article/143-how-to-create-a-link-without-a-backlink#arrowlinks))
### Time Blocks
For people using the AutoTimeBlocking plugin with the default settings, this hides the tag `#ðŸ•‘` which `/atb` includes on lines it creates: #ðŸ•‘
### Comments
You can hide comments until you move your cursor into them, either inline like this: %%something in the middle%%, or at the end of a line like this: // something at the end
### Special highlight
Some people have a special use for a highlight that runs until the end of the line. To do this insert a Pilcrow (Alt-7) Â¶ and see the effect.
### Fields and attributes
Fields: also supported, which might be useful for front matter, until fuller support for theming that emerges.
- Note: fields only apply at the start of a text line (not header, bullet etc.)
Attributes:: also can be highlighted at the start of a line.
### Tags in Template definitions
Here's a active tag: <% template tag %>  and one that is commented out: <%# commented out template tag %> .
### Code Block
```markdown
## Heading
Test code block :+\/ 
01234567890 ABCEDFGHijklmnopqrstu *with* **emphasis** and `things`.
1. list
* bullet
