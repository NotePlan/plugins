# NotePlan Plugins

This is the initial repository for [NotePlan app](https://noteplan.co/) plugins, available from release v3.0.22 (Mac & iOS).

The plugins work through [Command Bar Plugins](https://help.noteplan.co/article/65-commandbar-plugins)
for example:

If you are a user and have plugin ideas, [submit them here](https://feedback.noteplan.co/plugins-scripting) or ask in the [NotePlan Discord community](https://discord.gg/D4268MT)'s `#plugin-ideas` channel.

If you are a developer and want to contribute and build your plugins, see the [plugin writing documentation](https://help.noteplan.co/article/67-create-command-bar-plugins) and discuss this with other developers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/D4268MT) `#plugin-dev` channel.  Your might want to consult this [good modern JavaScript tutorial](https://javascript.info/).

More instructions below:
### Set up Repo and Tools

1. Clone this repository
2.  Make sure you have a recent version of `node` and `npm` installed. `brew install node` should do the trick.
3.  Run `npm install` from the root of your local GitHub repository for `noteplan/plugins`. This will install all the dependencies.
3. Copy the `np.plugin-flow-skeleton` folder and rename it per the instructions in the readme (here's where you'll create your plugin)
4.  Run `npm run autowatch` from a terminal in the GitHub root folder. The first time you run the script it will ask you for the full path to your live Plugins folder, and if you provide it, it will automatically copy the final js file and the plugin.json file in there automatically.<br />
   This includes setting up [eslint](https://eslint.org/) (for checking code conventions), [flow](https://flow.org/) (for type checking), [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (a JS compiler), and [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) (for bundling multiple source files into a single release).  Each have their own configuration files in the root; they can be overridden if needed by placing a more specific config file in the respective plugin's folders.

5. Install GitHub command line tools `gh` and authorise it for future use:
   ```
   > brew install gh
   > gh auth login
   Github.com > HTTPS > Yes Credentials > Login with web browser
   Enter (copy OTP code from command line)
   [Paste OTP code in browser window]
   ```

### Developer Automation Commands

These are the two most common commands you will use while developing:

1. **`npm run autowatch` from the root of your local GitHub `NotePlan/plugins` repo and your multi-file JS plugins will be compiled for you, and optionally be copied to your running NotePlan instance for testing**.  Not only that but it will then continue to _watch_ the folder and re-compile every time you save changes to a code file. NB: by default, this command will rebuild _all_ plugins just in case shared files affect another plugin. If you want to focus autowatch on a subset of plugins, you can pass the plugin folder name to autowatch like so:

- `npm run autowatch jgclark.DailyJournal dwertheimer.TaskAutomations`

2. **`npm run release "<plugin folder name>"`** (e.g. `npm run release "jgclark.DailyJournal"`) which will do all the work necessary to create/update a release in GitHub for the plugin. This will then automatically be available to all NotePlan users from the Plugins preference pane.

Note: The `autowatch` command is typically the only one you will need to use, especially if you use an IDE (e.g. VSCode) that does typechecking.

However, the following ones may be needed at times:
- `npm run build`: Will build all the plugins into single files (where needed)
- `npm run watch`: Will watch *all* files for changes and automatically compile them into single javascript files (where needed)
- `npm run typecheck`: Will typecheck all the javascript files with `Flow`. Only files with a `// @flow` comment are checked.
- `npm run fix`: Will lint and autoformat
- `npm run test`: Will lint and typecheck all Javascript files and report, but not fix anything
- `npm run lint`: Will run ESlint on the entire repo
- `npm run lint-fix`: Will run ESlint on the entire repo and fix whatever it can automatically fix
- `npm run format`: Will autoformat all Javascript files.
- `gh release delete <release name>`: Will delete the release from the repository, so making it unavailable in NotePlan as well. (Though it won't remove it from anyone who has already downloaded it.)
## Editor Setup

Use the setup guide for your preferred editor (we prefer Visual Studio Code), and then read the section on Working with Multiple Files.

### Visual Studio Code (recommended)

1. Install extensions for the following tools:
   1. `flow` "Flow Language Support" by flowtype
   2. `eslint` "ESLint" by Dirk Baeumer
   3. `prettier` "Prettier - Code formatter" by Prettier
2. Update Settings:
3. Set `prettier` to be the default formatter for js files.
   - You can open the Command Bar using `CMD+SHIFT+P` and then search for `Format Document`.
   - When you do this, you may get asked for a formatter of choice. Choose "Prettier"
   - If it asks you if this should be your default for all JS files, choose Yes.
4. Restart the editor to ensure the plug-ins are working.
   - You should see type errors when you make those
   - You should see lint errors when you format code wrong
   - You should see your code get autoformatted when you save
5. Make sure to open this folder directly in VSCode and not the entire repo as the ESLint plug-in can be annoying about that

### Sublime Text 3 and 4

1. Install the following extensions using Package Control
   1. `SublimeLinter` This allows various linters to work
   2. `SublimeLinter-eslint`
   3. `SublimeLinter-flow`
   4. `jsPrettier`
   5. `Babel` Syntax definitions for ES6 Javascript and React JSX extensions
2. Configure your packages:
   1. Open a `.js` file
   2. From the View menu, select Syntax → Open all with current extension as… → Babel → JavaScript (Babel)
   3. Open the package settings for `jsPrettier` and add `"auto_format_on_save": true,`

## Working with multiple files

Noteplan plugins need to be packaged as a single Javascript file, but that's not always a nice way to work.
So we use tools to package up multiple files into one.

Open up a terminal, and run `npm run autowatch` which will keep watching for JS file changes and will package up the plugin and copy it to your app Plugins directory.

If you don't have an editor set up to lint on the fly for you, run `npm run test` and it will give a list of problems to fix.
