// @flow
// Plugin code goes in files like this. Can be one per command, or several in a file.
// `export async function [name of jsFunction called by Noteplan]`
// then include that function name as an export in the index.js file also
// About Flow: https://flow.org/en/docs/usage/#toc-write-flow-code
// Getting started with Flow in NotePlan: https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/blob/main/Flow_Guide.md

// NOTE: This file is named NPPluginMain.js (you could change that name and change the reference to it in index.js)
// As a matter of convention, we use NP at the beginning of files which contain calls to NotePlan APIs (Editor, DataStore, etc.)
// Because you cannot easily write tests for code that calls NotePlan APIs, we try to keep the code in the NP files as lean as possible
// and put the majority of the work in the /support folder files which have Jest tests for each function
// support/helpers is an example of a testable file that is used by the plugin command
// REMINDER, to build this plugin as you work on it:
// From the command line:
// `noteplan-cli plugin:dev {{pluginId}} --test --watch --coverage`
// IMPORTANT: It's a good idea for you to open the settings ASAP in NotePlan Preferences > Plugins and set your plugin's logging level to DEBUG

/**
 * LOGGING
 * A user will be able to set their logging level in the plugin's settings (if you used the plugin:create command)
 * As a general rule, you should use logDebug (see below) for messages while you're developing. As developer,
 * you will set your log level in your plugin preferences to DEBUG and you will see these messages but
 * an ordinary user will not. When you want to output a message,you can use the following.
 * logging level commands for different levels of messages:
 *
 * logDebug(pluginJson,"Only developers or people helping debug will see these messages")
 * log(pluginJson,"Ordinary users will see these informational messages")
 * logWarn(pluginJson,"All users will see these warning/non-fatal messages")
 * logError(pluginJson,"All users will see these fatal/error messages")
