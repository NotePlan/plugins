Having no natural satellites and no atmosphere, it is subjected to frequent meteorite impacts and intense heat and radiation due to its proximity to the Sun. Its iron-rich core is surrounded by a mantel made up of silicate-rich rocks, with a thin crust of iron oxide-rich material on its exterior. Mercury is known for its extremely rapid rotational period and elliptical orbit, which cause the planet to experience extreme temperature ranges from -173°C to 427°C. As a result, it has a sparsely populated surface devoid of any signs of life.",
