# What's changed in üñ•Ô∏è  Window Tools?
_Please also see the Plugin [README](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/blob/main/jgclark.WindowSets/README.md)._

## [1.2.0] - 2024-03-15
- new **swap splits** command that swaps the currently-selected split to main, or if no split is currently selected, asks the user which to swap (thanks to suggestion by @antony-skylar)
- fix to main Editor window not being relocated correctly at times (thanks to report by @dwertheimer)
- update automatic trigger name on special Window Sets definition note to make it consistent with others. (If you don't know what this is, you don't need to worry about it!)

## [1.1.2] - 2024-03-12
- when it writes example Window Sets it now uses the local machine name, to avoid it appearing that there are no saved Window Sets, and it now  automatically syncs it to the pref as well.
- bug fix in /delete window set.

## [1.1.1] - 2024-03-12
- improved settings migration from previous 'WindowSets' plugin
- improved documentation on where the Window Set definitions live

## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-28
- added x-callbacks for /open window set, /open note in new split and /open note in new window commands
- fixed bugs in test command "/write window set pref to note"
- moved some code around

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-02
Renamed plugin to '**üñ•Ô∏è  Window Tools**' (at v1.0.0) as it now covers more than just Window Sets:
- new command **/move split to main** (alias: /mstm) that moves the current split pane to be the first one in the main window
- new command **/constrain main window** (alias: /cmw) moves the main window to make sure its fully in the screen area, shrinking it if it needs to.

Also the following window-management commands have moved from Note Helpers:
- **open note in new split**: (alias: /onns) opens a user-selected note in a new split of the main window
- **open note in new window** (alias: /onnw) opens a user-selected note in a new window
- **open current in new split**: (alias: /ocns) opens the current note again in a new split of the main window
- **open current in new window**: (alias: /ocnw) opens the current note again in a new floating window

<!-- ## [0.5.0b1] - 2023-10-27
First private attempt to use updated API to deal with split window widths properly in saving and opening window sets. In particular:
- FIXME: added a new command **/set editor width** (alias: /sew), which tests this new functionality. -->

## [0.4.0] - 2023-10-20
**This is the first public release. It requires NotePlan v3.9.8.**
- wrote most documentation
- now checks that windows live within the visible screen area, and moves them if not, shrinking if necessary
- smarter mechanism for guessing plugin (HTML) windows details by developer convention
- now knows which Mac a WindowSet was defined on, and now will only offer to open WindowSets from that same Mac. This helps users with multiple machines with different sized monitors, including me.
- add update trigger a different way, and fixed it dealing with stale data
- fix problem where regular notes' filenames weren't being saved

## [0.3.0] - 2023-09-28 (unreleased; following change of design)
- Window Set definitions now live in a hidden preference, _but can be automatically sync'd to/from a user's note to see what's going on_. See README for details.
- added a lookup list (held in src/WSHelpers.js::pluginWindowsAndCommands) to automatically identify plugin (HTML) windows where known.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-09-10 (unfinished; unreleased -- decided to change design)
- Window Set definitions now live in notes. See README for details. Can now have any number of defined window sets.
- **/Save window set** command. Now includes window size and position for floating windows. (Incomplete: doesn't yet work for updating existing Window Set definition.)

## [0.1.0] - 2023-04-04
- First basic working version. Note: only catering for 5 window sets, due to limitiation of configuration system.
