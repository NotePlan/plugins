# 🔁 Repeat Extension plugin

NotePlan has a simple [built-in repeat mechanism](https://noteplan.co/faq/Notes%20&%20Todos/How%20to%20create%20a%20recurring%20or%20repeating%20todo/), which allows for `@repeat(1/n)`.  That wasn't flexible enough for my purposes, so I wrote this plugin to allow repeats **every x days, weeks, months, quarters or years**. It does the work of creating the next task using information from completed tasks that include a `@repeat(interval)` string and a completed `@done(...)` date.

Here are some examples:

| Type of repeat | The original line | The result after completing the task and then running /rpt |
|-----|-----|-----|
| every Monday (starting 2023-07-10) | `* task @repeat(1w) >2023-07-10` | `* task @repeat(1w) >2023-07-17` (i.e. the next Monday) <br /> `* [x] task @repeat(1w) >2023-07-10 @done(...) ` |
| 1st of the month (starting 2023-08-01) | `* do expenses @repeat(1m) >2023-08-01` | `* do expenses @repeat(1m) >2023-09-01` (i.e. the next month start) <br /> `* [x] do expenses @repeat(1m) >2023-08-01 @done(...) ` |
| every 2 weeks | `* put out recycling @repeat(2w)` | `* put out recycling @repeat(2w) >2021-07-15` <br /> `* [x] put out recycling @repeat(2w) @done(2021-07-01)` |
| 2 months after last done | `* top up washer fluid @repeat(+2m)` | `* top up washer fluid @repeat(+2m) >2023-09-04` <br /> `* [x] top up washer fluid @repeat(+2m) @done(2023-07-04)` |

See below for more details.

Compared with the built-in functionality, it also allows you to easily change the text of a repeated task, which otherwise means visiting all the future notes with repeats.

## Configuration
For this feature to work, **you need to have the 'Append Completion Date' setting turned on in Preferences > Todo**, and not to mind the time portion of the `@done(...)` tag being removed, as a sign that the line has been processed.

In the Plugin Settings pane you can set 'Delete completed item?', which deletes the completed repeated item.

## Running it Automatically
From NotePlan v3.7.2, this plugin can **automatically generate** the new repeated task after you complete an existing one. Here's an example (from v0.5) where it will repeat 6 weeks after completion:

<img src="repeat-auto-mode.gif" width="500px">

This requires adding the following [trigger line](https://help.noteplan.co/article/173-plugin-note-triggers) to the frontmatter at the start of _every note_ you wish to automate in this way:
``` yaml
---
title: <<the note's title on this line, instead of a markdown H1 title>>
triggers: onEditorWillSave => jgclark.RepeatExtensions.onEditorWillSave
---
```
Tip: This is most easily done by using the **/add trigger to note** command from my [Note Helpers plugin](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.NoteHelpers/).

Alternatively, the separate [Tidy Up plugin](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/blob/main/np.Tidy/README.md) has a **/Generate @repeats in recent notes** command, which runs over all recently-changed notes, generating any new @repeats that are required. It does _not_ require triggers to be in place.

## Running it Manually
On the _currently open note_, open the command bar and type the **/generate repeats** command.
- When run on a _Project note_, it creates the new repeated task straight before the completed task.
- When run on a _Calendar note_, it creates the new repeated task on the date of the new repeat. This uses the same calendar note type: so a repeat in a weekly note will go to the appropriate weekly note, etc.

## Specifiying the Intervals
The time intervals have two parts: number and then a character. The **character** is one of:
- `b` or `B`: business days (ignore weekends, but doesn't ignore public holidays, as they're different for each country)
- `d` or `D`: days
- `w` or `W`: weeks
- `m` or `M`: months
- `q` or `Q`: quarters
- `y` or `Y`: years

When the **number** starts with a **+** (e.g. `+1m`) it will duplicate the task for 1 month after the date the _task was completed_.
When the number doesn't start with a + (e.g. `1m`) it will duplicate the task for 1 month after the date the _task was last due_. This is found from a `>yyyy-mm-dd` scheduled date. When there is no scheduled date, then for _Calendar notes_ it will duplicate the task for 1 month after the note date, and for _Project notes_ it will duplicate the task for 1 month after the _task was completed_.

From v0.6 you can specify scheduled dates to all the other calendar note types supported by NotePlan:
- weekly (e.g. `>2023-W28`)
- monthly (e.g. `>2023-07`)
- quarterly (e.g. `>2023-Q3`)
- yearly (e.g. `>2023`)

The resulting repeat lines will also be specified using that same note type, and will write to the appropriate new calendar note (unless it came from a project note, in which case it will stay in the same project note).
