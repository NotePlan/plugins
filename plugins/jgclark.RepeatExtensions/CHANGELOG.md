# What's changed in 🔁 Repeat Extensions plugin?
Please see the [Readme for this plugin](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.RepeatExtensions) for more details, including the available settings. For this plugin to work, **you need to have the 'Append Completion Date' setting turned on in Preferences > Todo**.

## [0.8.2] - 2024-11-02
- turn off warning on deleting `@repeat()`s -- useful if you have Delete Completed Repeats setting turned on. Note: requires NotePlan v3.15 beta from 2024-11-02 or later.

## [0.8.1] - 2024-06-14
- fixed bug and improved logging

## [0.8.0] - 2024-06-09
- added setting 'Delete completed item?', which when set deletes rather than keeps the completed repeated item.
<!-- - fix detailed logging error in dateTime::cODS -->

## [0.7.1] - 2024-06-07
- can now be run from an x-callback or function, passing in the note to process. This was needed for the new Tidy plugin command, which generate any needed repeats in all recently-changed notes.

## [0.7.0] - 2024-03-08
- adjust new date calculation: when there is no task due date, use the note date if it exists, otherwise default to (current behavior) of task completion date. (PR by @ameritrash)
- fix to @repeat(1m) repeats in a monthly note not being written into a monthly note (etc.)

## [0.6.1] - 2023-09-29
- fixed repeats from daily calendar notes (reported by @lnrdgmt)
- fixed double dates appearing (reported by @lbednarski)

## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-07
- support for repeats on dates specified as `>YYYY-MM` (month), `>YYYY-Qq` (quarter) and `YYYY` (year) as well as day and week. For example `* do something monthly @repeat(1m) >2023-07`.  These can be used in project or calendar notes.
- support for repeats in monthly/quarterly/yearly calendar notes, as well as daily and weekly ones. The next repeat can be written into any of those, depending on the offset interval specified. e.g. `@repeat(1q)` will write the next repeat into the appropriate quarterly note (if it didn't come from a project note).
- new **/Repeats: update plugin settings** command for iOS users

## [0.5.2] - 2023-03-15
### Changed
<!-- - Now internally running from Editor only -->
- Now will write the new repeat date as a week-style date (e.g. `>2023-W11`) where either the task is in a weekly note, or the scheduling of the repeat is for a weekly date.
### Fixed
- Fixed error when running from calendar notes (thanks to @DHERRADOR and @dbcoyer for the report)

## [0.5.1] - 2023-01-17
### Changed
- the @repeat(...) intervals can now use uppercase B,D,W,M,Q,Y characters. (for advanced Templating work by @DocJulien and @dwertheimer)

## [0.5.0] - 2022-12-22
### Added
- new repeats using this extended syntax can now be generated automatically after you complete an existing one. This requires NotePlan v3.7.2, and adding this line to frontmatter at the start of every note you wish to automate in this way:
``` yaml
---
triggers: onEditorWillSave => jgclark.RepeatExtensions.onEditorWillSave
---
```

## [0.4.0] - 2022-11-08
### Added
- will now find and process repeats in Weekly notes as well as other notes
- added logging options

## [0.3.1] - 2022-02-20
### Changed
- can now be called by the command `/generate repeats`, (alias `/rpt`)
- code refactoring

## [0.3.0] - 2021-10-24
### Added
- now tells user if no suitable repeats were found to process, to make it clear that it did run

### Fixed
- the new repeats now don't show as 'scheduled' (i.e. starting `* [>]`) but just as ordinary open tasks (`* [ ] `), which then makes them visible in the references area, as intended (thanks to @orionp for pointing this out)

## [0.2.1..0.2.4] - 2021-06-29
### Added
- new: where the repeat is in a daily note, now 'throw' the new repeat of the task into the future date. (Note this is currently waiting on a fix to the API to be implemented fully.)
### Changed
- updated: now compiled for macOS versions back to 10.13.0.
- improve: quality of month interval calculations
- update: following API fix, future repeats are created OK in daily notes

## Fixed
- fix: allow for other date localisations (that make `@done()` include versions of AM/PM string as well)

## [0.2.0] - 2021-05-27
### Added
- first released version for plugin, ported to JavaScript plugin framework from my [npTools Ruby script](https://github.com/jgclark/NotePlan-tools/).
