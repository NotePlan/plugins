# ðŸ”Œ Plugin Information & Tester - Noteplan Plugin by @dwertheimer

View Plugin Commands and Test that Plugins are working

## Commands

### /Generate Plugin Command Listing

This command generates a NotePlan note with all the plugins, descriptions and commands. Also, gives you links to try out the various commands. You can limit the listing to plugins you've already downloaded or include all plugins, including the ones you haven't downloaded yet. (and you can click to install the ones that look interesting)

### /(Test) Write Editor Paragraph Details to Console Log

The simplest of all plugin commands. Designed to test that plugins work for you at all. Emits one console.log (Noteplan > Help > Plugin Console) and also inserts test text at the cursor in an active Editor window. If you see both, plugins work for you. 

This is all it does:
