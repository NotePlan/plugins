# What's changed in ðŸ“™ Note Helpers plugin?
For more details see the [plugin's README](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.NoteHelpers/).
<!-- ### Added
<!-- TODO: Decide whether to shift "/add number of days to dates" to a different plugin -->
<!-- - improve logging for **add trigger to note** command to try to work out why it is failing from templates. -->

## [0.19.1] - 2024-02-23
- **add trigger to note** command can now be run from x-callback with parameter of the trigger string to add. This means it can be run from Templates with a command tag.
- Added a migration message about 'open note' commands.

## [0.19.0] - 2024-01-09
- moved the "open note in ..." commands to the new "Window Tools" plugin
- updated the display of the "index folders" command to use heading levels H2 to H4 depending on how deep the sub-folder is. The placeholder in the title `{{folder}}` now just uses the last part of the folder name, or new placeholder `{{full_folder_path}}` which will use the folder's full path. (Requested by @dutchnesss).
- removed 'Show month/quarter/year' commands as they are now in the main NP menus.
- fix to '/rename inconsistent filename' command (reported by @anton-sklyar)
- fix to '/make index' command ignoring parameter 'displayOrder' if given.

## [0.18.2] - 2023-09-18
- fix edge case with /add trigger command.

## [0.18.1] - 2023-08-15
- New commands by @Leo:
  - "/list inconsistent note filenames": lists the names of notes whose filenames are inconsistent with their titles
  - "/rename filename to title": renames the current filename to the title of the note
- when the command bar shows list of notes to choose, it now includes Template files again.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-08-13
- new command **Show This Month** (alias /stm)
- new command **Show This Quarter** (alias /stq)
- new command **Show This Year** (alias /sty) (requested by @danieldanilov)
- new command **update all indexes** that updates all the existing folder index notes
- added more decoration to most-used calendar dates, when showing them in lists of notes (e.g. in "jump to note's heading" and "open note new window").

## [0.17.3] - 2023-07-01
- added new setting 'Title to use for index notes' for "/index folders" command (requested by @dwertheimer)
- layout improvements and further bug fix  in "/index folders" (spotted by @dwertheimer)

## [0.17.2] - 2023-06-30
### Fixed
- fix bug in **/index folders** (spotted by @dwertheimer)

## [0.17.0] - 2023-06-12
### Added
- new **/open url from a note** command that asks user for a note, and then presents a list of URLs. The selected one is then opened in your default browser. (for @John1 with help from @dwertheimer)
- now **/move note** and **/index folders** commands offer option to create a new folder when selecting a folder (suggested by @dwertheimer)
- new **/reset caches** command that just runs the command of that name in the NotePlan Help menu (for @clayrussell)

## [0.16.1] - 2023-03-22
### Added
- added **/NoteHelpers: update settings** command for iOS users
- added setting for logging level
### Changed
- '/add trigger to note' command now is smarter in the way it works
- restores "Default Text to add to frontmatter" setting for '/convert note to frontmatter' command

## [0.16.0] - 2023-03-07
### Added
- new **/add trigger to note** command that makes it easy to add a trigger to a particular note. It lists the functions from all plugins that it can work out are written for triggers, but also allows any function to be picked.
- **/index folders** now:
  - has an option to sort output by title (alphabetical), last update date, or date the note was created (though note that I think that the underlying created date data is very unreliable).
  - has an option to add one of several date display settings on the end of every note that's listed
  - has a Refresh button at the top of each results set
  - can be run from x-callback-url calls (see README).
### Fixed
- **/convert to frontmatter** wasn't always working for calendar notes

## [0.15.0] - 2022-07-30
### Added
- new command **/rename note filename** renames the currently open note. Note: this changes the underlying _filename_ not the visible _title_. (It only works with NotePlan v3.6.1 and later.)
- new command **/enable heading links** converts local links to headings (they start with the `#` character) to `x-callback-url` links that use the Noteplan URL-scheme to run the `jumpToHeading` function mentioned below. So while Noteplan doesn't support the standard way of linking to headings within notes, this plugin command now enables that feature if you're willing to change the destination of your links.  (by @nmn)
### Updated
- The command **/jump to heading** (which is used for jumping to headings within the same note) can now be used via `x-callback-url`s by passing the text of the heading in as an arg0.

## [0.14.1] - 2022-06-12 (by @nmn)
### Added
- new command **/add number of days to dates** that looks for bullets in your current open note that end with `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]:` and adds the number of days to or since that date.

### Changed
- when using **/open note new window** or **/open note new split** it now places the cursor at what it judges to be the start of the main content of the note (i.e. after title or frontmatter) or project-related metadata.
