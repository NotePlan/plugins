# ðŸ“™ NoteHelpers plugin
This plugin provides these commands to help jump quickly between NotePlan notes, and manage them:
- `/index`: Make/Update note link Indexes for one or more folders
- `/jh`: jumps the cursor to the selected heading in the current note
- `/jn`: jump to a different note, and then selected heading
- `/jd`: simply jumps the cursor to the `## Done` section of the current note (if it exists)
- `/mn`: which moves a note to a different folder the user selects
- `/onw`: open a user-selected note in a new NotePlan window

It now has added the `/index` command to make/update note link Indexes for one or more folders.
