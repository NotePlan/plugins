- **/open current note new split** (alias **/ocns**): open the current note again in a new split of the main window (and places the cursor at what it judges to be the start of the main content)
- **/jump to note's heading** (alias **/jh**): jumps the cursor to the selected heading in the current note
- **/jump to note** (alias **/jn**): jump to a different note, and then selected heading
- **/jump to done** (alias **/jd**): simply jumps the cursor to the `## Done` section of the current note (if it exists)
- **/move note** (alias **/mn**): which moves a note to a different folder the user selects
