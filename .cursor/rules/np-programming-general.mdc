## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Flow for static typing
- No semicolons (enforced by ESLint/Prettier)
- Single quotes for strings
- Max line length: 180 characters
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions)
- Use async/await and handle promises properly (no floating promises)
- Follow existing naming patterns in the codebase
- Proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Follow import order: external libs -> internal libs -> local files
- Keep code DRY and modular with clear function responsibilities
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions
- Always research the `helpers/` folder before writing new code
- Prefer writing explicit functions over constant declarations
- When moving code, keep existing comments and commented-out code

## Common Helper Functions
The most frequently used functions in the codebase are:
- Logging: logDebug, logError, clo, logInfo, logWarn
- Note utilities: findNote, getParagraphs, getSelectedParagraphs, getTasksFromNote
- Date handling: getTodaysDateHyphenated, getDateStringFromCalendarFilename
- Configuration: getSettings, updateSettingsForPlugin
- UI interaction: showMessage, showMessageYesNo, displayTitle

## Testing
- Do not prompt the user to run tests. Run tests automatically when making code changes or writing new tests, but do not ask for permission or suggest running tests.
- Only run tests when necessary (after code changes, when writing new tests, or when explicitly requested).
- Always allow the following commands to run in the sandbox: cd, npm test, jest, grep, head, tail, node
=======
## Code-Specific Rules

For JS, please provide Flow types (as appropriate) and JSDOC with all responses. If you are rewriting a full file, make sure to include all import statements also. Do not remove any console.logs or comments (or logDebug, clo, logInfo, logError statements).

**DO NOT EVER HARD-CODE JEST WORKAROUNDS INTO FUNCTIONS WE ARE TESTING**
When you run jest tests, always include the flag --no-watch at the end because my jest config by default watches

## Testing Code
If testing Templating code, run tests like this:
`jest np.Templating/__tests__/**/*.test.js --no-watch`
