### New
- new **Remove triggers from recent calendar notes** command which removes one or more triggers from recent (but past) calendar notes. (This could be used as part of a daily or weekly Template.)
- new option "‚û°Ô∏è Ignore this note from now on" in the **File root-level notes** command, which populates the 'Root notes to ignore' setting for you. (For @dwertheimer.) Note: this only works from NP 3.9.2 build 1036 onwards.
- new **update plugin settings** command that can be run on iOS devices
- new setting "Run commands silently?". When running commands silently, they will run entirely in the background and not pop up dialogs to check or report success.
