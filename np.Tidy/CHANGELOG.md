- **Remove section from all notes** (alias "rsan"). Remove a given section (both the heading and its content) from all notes. (Can be used with parameters from Template or x-callback.)  _Dangerous!_
- **Remove time parts from @done() dates** (alias "rtp"): Remove time parts of @done(date time) from recently-updated notes. Can be used with parameters from Template or Callback.
- **Remove @done() markers** (alias "rdm"): Remove @done() markers from recently-updated notes.

Most can be used with parameters from a Template, or via an x-callback call.
