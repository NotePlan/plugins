## [1.1.3-beta.02] - 2022-05-07 (mikeerickson)

- fix regression introduced in 1.1.2-beta.03 related to replacing `---` with `*****`, was perform replacement too soon
  - Revealed in jgclark.DailyJournal

## [1.1.3-beta.01] - 2022-05-06 (mikeerickson)

WIP - Publishing Internal for @jgclark test with `/dayStart`

## [1.1.2-beta.04] - 2022-05-04 (mikeerickson)

- Interval validation passed (confirmed by @eduard, @dwertheimer, and @jgclark)
- Removed `/Test` condition applied to `1.1.2-beta.03`

## [1.1.2-beta.03] - 2022-05-04 (mikeerickson)

IMPORTANT: Internal beta 03 release is migration templates to "@Templates/Test".  This "Test" will be removed when released to public

- additional migration adjustments
- automatically correct template rendering when `---` used as separator in body of template (replaced with `*****`)
- when migrating templates, all `---` in template body (after frontmatter) will be replaced with `****`

Template Migration should only take place under the following conditions
1. There are existing templates in "ðŸ“‹ Templates" folder
2. There are 0 tempaltes in "@Templates" folder which don't have a template containing `tags: migrated-template`

If there are > 0 templates which have `tags: migrated-template` migration will NOT be executed.  This is how I can determine if a previous migration was executed
Also, it should be encouraged to rename "ðŸ“‹ Templates" to another name "ðŸ“‹ Templates (Legacy)" after it has been determined migration was successful, I can update the np.Templating docs about this

## [1.1.2-beta.02] - 2022-05-03 (mikeerickson)

- small adjustment to the template migration checker

## [1.1.2-beta.01] - 2022-05-03 (mikeerickson)

- public beta release, confirming template migration code is not executed when migration has already occurred.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-05-03 (mikeerickson)

- fixed issue which was prompting tempalte migration when install or updating `np.Templating` plugin

## [1.1.0] - 2022-05-02 (mikeerickson)

- public release

## [1.1.0-beta.02] - 2022-05-01 (mikeerickson)

- fixed date math when using `.now()` command with `offset` parameter
- deprecated `pickDate` will now return message stating deprecation, point to using `promptDate`
- deprecated `pickDateInterval` will now return message stating deprecation, point to using `promptDateInterval`

> Examples: `<%- date.now('',10) %>`, `<%- date.now('', -90) %>`,  `<%- date.now('', '10w') %>`, `<%- date.now('', '-3M') %>`

## [1.1.0-beta.01] - 2022-04-30 (mikeerickson)

- made adjustments to the template migration code, no longer skipped if `np.Templating` sessions exist
> Note: You can execute `np:migrate-templates` at any time if you need to rexecute migration
- add template migration code to `init` method so it will be executed for each np.Templating command
> This will assure templates have been migrated should something of happened and they were not migrated during np.Templating installation
- fixed tag details (removed `<%=` from documentation, will be supported internally but not an "official" tag`)
- removed `np:mtn` command (and removed from documentation) as it was conflicting with `np.MeetingNotes` implementation
- fixed `np:new` which was not using entered note title (if `newNoteTitle` does not exist in template attributes)
- fixed issue with `NPTemplating.getFolder` interface, was displaying "Choose Destination Folder" even though a default folder was supplied
- added `trim()` to weather output, fixing an issue when applying NotePlan _italic_ style
> `*<%- web.weather() %>*` would be rendered as a todo item
- added `promptDate` which should be used instead of `pickDate` so `placeholder` value can be used in same template in different location
- added `promptInterval` which should be used instead of `pickInterval` so `placeholder` value can be used in same template in different location
- fixed issues with `templateLocale` not be used properly in some methods in `DateModule`
- implemented workaround issue with `date.dayNumber()` when running in locales not `en` or `en-US`
- removed hard coded `discuss` variable in template rendering, would have collided if there was a variable in the rendering process which was `dicsuss`
- fixed prompt interface to only ouput prompt value when using output tag `<%-`
> for example, the following will get retrieve the prompt value into variable, but will not show value when template rendered
> `<% prompt('myVar','Enter myVar;') %>`
