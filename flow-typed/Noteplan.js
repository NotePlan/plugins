// @flow

/*
 * # How Flow Definitions work:
 *
 * ## The `+` before keys within object types means that key is read-only.
 * - Flow editor plugins should give autocomplete for various keys.
 * - Some editor plugins should also show you documentation during autocomplete
 *
 * ## Declaring Global Variables
 * - Every `declare var` declares a variable that is available globally
 * - Every `type` declaration defines that type to be used globally as well.
 * - The `.eslintrc` will also need to be updated to ignore these globals
 *
 * ## Unique Names
 * Variables and Types *must* have unique names from each other. So when there
 * is a collision, the type names is prefixed with a `T`.
 * e.g. `Editor` and `TEditor`.

   *  3. define one of the timeframes: "days", "weeks", "months", "quarters", "years".
