# Favorites Plugin

## A temporary substitute for "pinned notes"
Somewhere on the Noteplan roadmap is (hopefully) the concept of pinned notes (see [Canny](https://noteplan.canny.io/general-feature-request/p/favorite-notesfolders-and-pinning-notes-to-the-top-of-the-list)). In the meantime, I thought I would create a poor man's substitute -- inspired by @stacey's idea of having an evergreen "Research This" note, which I wanted to have easy access to.

## Using the Favorites ⭐️ Plugin
1. At the beginning, no items are in the Favorites list
2. Open up any document in the Editor
2. Run the `/fave` plugin to set the current document as a "Favorite"
3. [This adds a ⭐️ to the title, which indicates this file is a "Favorite"]
4. Now run the `/faves` command and you will see your favorites. 
5. Choosing a favorite opens it in the Editor
6. Use the `/unfave`  command to remove the ⭐️ (or you can do it by hand)!
