# ðŸ”¢ Statistics plugin
This plugin provides some simple statistics:

- **/note stats** (alias **/nc**): shows counts of all the notes in NotePlan
- **/task stats for all notes** (alias **/tsp**): shows task statistics for all regular and calendar notes (other than in the Archive or Trash)
- **/task stats for current note** (alias **/tc**): shows task counts for the current note
- **/word stats for current notes** (alias **/wc**): shows word count and other numbers for the open note

The calculated stats are shown in the command bar, and a copy written to the plugin console.

## Configuration
