# What's changed in ðŸ”¬ Reviews plugin?
See [website README for more details](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.Review), and how to configure.

## [0.6.3] - 2022-05-01
### Fixed
- configuration problem, potentially leading to NP crash (reported by @Harv)

## [0.6.2] - 2022-04-25
### Added
- added 6 new settings, to allow you to change the various special project strings from '@start', '@completed', '@cancelled', '@due', '@review' and '@reviewed' to ones of your own choosing.
### Changed
- change to newer logging system
- remove ability to use older _configuration note; now all settings come through the Plugin preference pane's Settings screen.

## [0.6.1] - 2022-02-04
### Changed
- now using new Configuration UI system instead of _configuration.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-01-27
### Added
- new  `/cancel project` command that works analagously to the `/complete project` command
- added new 'finishedListHeading' string setting for these two commands. See README for details.
### Changed
- improved output of `/complete project` and `/cancel project` commands
- re-factored code to make more re-usable

## [0.5.2] - 2022-01-21
### Added
- progress indicator when running longer commands
- `/complete project` now also adds note to a yearly note in Summaries folder (if the folder exists), and offers to move the note to the NotePlan Archive.

## [0.5.1] - 2022-01-03
### Changed
- removed `addProject` command. I've realised the equivalent is now available already by setting up the `/qtn` command in Templates plugin. See my [README](README.md) for details.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-12-28
### Changed
- the `foldersToExclude` setting now means `/startReviews` and `projectLists` commands ignore any sub-folders of the specified ones as well
- tweaked the output to show overdue reviews in **bold**
- improved code documentation

### Fixed
- will no longer ignore notes in the root folder (thanks to @Matthias for the report)

## [0.4.4..0.4.5] - 2021-12-09
### Fixed
- /projectList could fail on invalid `@due()` dates; made the metadata line reader more resilient

## [0.4.1..0.4.3] - 2021-10-24
### Fixed
- updated some warning messages
- found that NP strips out hash symbols from note titles; this led to duplicate Review notes (later reported as #138 by @codedungeon)
- typo in default configuration that gets copied to _configuration

## [0.4.0] - 2021-09-10
### Added
- new command `/addProject` that adds a new note using your template 'New Project Template' (if defined)

### Changed
- under-the-hood change: the `/startReviews` and `nextReview` commands now use the (invisible) preferences system available from v3.1.0, rather than the (visible) `_reviews` note. _This requires NotePlan v3.1.0 (build 654) or greater._

## [0.3.0] - 2021-08-21
### Added
- new support for projects labelled `#cancelled` or `#someday` -- these are marked differently in the output lists
- new setting `displayArchivedProjects` which for the command `/projectLists` controls whether to display project notes marked `#archive`
### Changed
- update: changes the `noteTypeTags` setting to be an array of strings not a comma-separated string. E.g. `noteTypeTags: ["#area", "#project"]`

## [0.2.1..0.2.3] - 2021-08-01
### Added
- new command `/completeProject` that adds a `@completed(today)` date,
- new setting `foldersToIgnore` that allows an array of folder names to ignore in the commands

### Fixed
- contents of sub-folders were being duplicated in the lists
