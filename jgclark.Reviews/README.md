# ðŸ”¬ Projects + Reviews plugin
Unlike many task or project management apps, NotePlan has very little enforced structure, and is entirely text/markdown based.  This makes it much more flexible, but makes it less obvious how to use it for tracking and managing complex work, loosely referred to here as 'Projects'.

This plugin provides commands to help **review** Project-based notes, and it helps me manage over 50 such projects. This will be familiar to people who use David Allen's **Getting Things Done** approach, or any other where **regular reviews** are important. (It probably won't have much applicability to people who just use NotePlan as a Zettelkasten-style knowledge base.)

If, like me, you're using the helpful [PARA Approach](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/para/), then your **Areas** are also a form of Project, at least as far as Reviewing them goes.  I have another 50 of these.

User George Crump (@george65) has created a video showing how the plugin works: (Note: it was created back at v0.7, so it looks rather different now.)

## Using NotePlan for Project-like work
Each **Project** is described by a separate note, and has a lifecycle something like this:

![project lifecycle](project-flowchart_bordered.jpg)

Each such project contains the `#project` hashtag, `@review(...)` and some other metadata fields on a line (which I suggest comes after the title).  For example:

![Example of a Project and the fields to use](secret-undertaking-example-bordered.jpg)
<!-- ```markdown
# Secret Undertaking
#project @review(2w) @reviewed(2021-07-20) @start(2021-04-05) @due(2021-11-30)
Aim: Do this amazing secret thing
Progress: 10@2022-01-07: Had the briefing and got 007 on the case

## Details
* [x] Get briefing from 'M' at HQ
* [x] recruit James Bond
* task Q with building a personal jetpack (with USB ports)
* set up team Deliveroo account
...
``` -->

The fields I use are:
- `@review(...)`: interval to use between reviews, of form [number][bdwmqy]:
    - After the [number] is a character, which is one of: **b**usiness days (ignore weekends, but doesn't ignore public holidays, as they're different for each country), **d**ays, **w**eeks, **m**onths, **q**uarters, **y**ears.
- `@reviewed(YYYY-MM-DD)`: last time this project was reviewed, using this plugin
- `@start(YYY-MM-DD)`: project's start date
- `@due(YYY-MM-DD)`: project's due date
- `@completed(YYY-MM-DD)`: date project was completed (if relevant)
- `@cancelled(YYY-MM-DD)`: date project was cancelled (if relevant)
- `Aim: free text`: optional, and not used in any processing
- `Progress: N:YYYY-MM-DD: free text ...`: your latest summary of progress for this N% (optional)

Similarly, if you follow the **PARA method**, then you will also have "**Areas** of responsibility" to maintain, and I use a `#area` tag to mark these. These don't normally have a start/end/completed dates, but they also need reviewing.  For example:

```markdown
# Car maintenance
#area @review(1m) @reviewed(2021-06-25)
Aim: Make sure car continues to run well, is legal etc.

* check tyres @repeat(+1m) >2021-07-23
* pay car/road tax @repeat(1y) >2021-10-11
* book yearly service @repeat(1y) >2022-02-01
...
```

The first hashtag on the line defines its type, so as well as `#project`, `#area` you could have a `#goal` or whatever makes most sense for you. (This example uses my related [Repeat Extensions plugin](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.RepeatExtensions/) to give more flexibility than the built-in repeats.)

Other notes:
- If you also add the `#paused` tag to the metadata line, then that stops that note from being included in active reviews, but will show up in the lists.
- From v0.9 these 'metadata fields' can appear anywhere in the note, not just on the second line. If there are multiple copies of a field, only the first one is used.
- I'm sometimes asked why I use `@reviewed(2021-06-25)` rather than `@reviewed/2021-06-25`. The answer is that while the latter form is displayed in a neater way in the sidebar, the date part isn't available in the NotePlan API as the part after the slash is not a valid @tag as it doesn't contain an alphabetic character.

## Reviewing Projects and/or Areas
Use the 'Hashtags to review' setting to control which notes are included in the review lists:
- If this setting is empty, then it will include all notes for review that include a `@review(...)` string.
- if it is set (e.g. `#project, #area, #goal`), then it will include just those notes which also have one or more of those tags.
- You can specify folders to ignore using the 'Folders to Ignore' setting; I have this set to `Summaries, Reviews, Saved Searches`. (Note that the special Templates, Archive and Trash are always excluded.)

When you have [configured the plugin](#configuration), and added suitable metadata to notes, you're then ready to use some or all of the following commands:

### "/project lists" command
This shows a list of project notes, including basic tasks statistics and time until next review, and time until the project is due to complete. **Tip**: Place this list next to your main NotePlan window, and you can click on each project title in the table, and it will open in the main window ready to review and update.

From v0.8 you can set the '**Output style to use**'. This is either a '**Rich**' (HTML) or original '**Markdown**' (normal NotePlan) output style:

<!-- FIXME: update screenshot -->
![Example of Rich style of "/project lists"](review-list4-rich.jpg)
![Example of Markdown style of "/project lists"](review-list4-md.jpg)

Notes about the displays:
- the **Rich style** _isn't a normal NotePlan note that is saved and can be accessed again later_. You will need to re-run the command to see the list again once you close the window.  This 'Rich' style mimics the NotePlan Theme you use. 
- in the 'Rich' style this heading row deliberately 'sticks' to the top of the window as you scroll the list.
![Example of buttons in Rich style of "/project lists"](review-list-buttons3.jpg)
- due to limits on the API for 'Rich' style output, all #tags to review get shown one after the other in a single window.
- if you can make the window wide enough it will display in 2 or even 3 columns!
- the **Markdown style** list _is_ stored in summary note(s) in the 'Reviews' folder (or whatever you set the 'Folder to store' setting to be).
- the button 'Start reviews' / 'Start reviewing notes ready for review' is a shortcut to the '/start reviews' command (described next).
- each project title is also an active link which can be clicked to take you to that project note. (Or Option-click to open that in a new split window, which keeps the review list open.)

Other settings:
- Specify folders to ignore using the 'Folders to ignore' shared setting (as above).
- Display project dates?  Whether to display the project's review and due dates (where set).
- Display project's latest progress?  Whether to show the project's latest progress (where available). If a specific 'Progress:' field is set it will use that, otherwise it will calculate %completion based on the number of completed and open tasks.
- Display order for projects: The sort options  are by 'due' date, by 'review' date or 'title'.
- Display grouped by folder? Whether to group the projects by their folder.
- Hide top level folder? Whether to suppress higher-level folder names in project list headings.
- Display archived projects? Whether to display project notes marked as `#archive`.

#### Running from x-callback call
From v0.8 this command can be run from an x-callback call:

`noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=jgclark.Reviews&command=project%20lists`

If you wish to override your current settings for this call, add `&arg0=` followed by a URL encoded version of keys and values e.g. `arg0=displayDates%3Dtrue%2CdisplayProgress%3Dfalse%2CdisplayGroupedByFolder%3Dfalse`.

The name of the settings are taken from the `key`s from the plugin's `plugin.json` file, which are mostly the names shown in the settings dialog without spaces.

### "/start reviews" command
This creates a hidden list of notes ready for review, and then kicks off the most overdue review by opening that note in the editor. When you have finished the review run one of the next two commands ...

### "/finish review" command
This updates the current open project's `@reviewed(date)`, and if a Rich style project list is open, it is refreshed.

### "/next review" command
This updates this project's `@reviewed(date)`, and jumps to the next project to review. If there are none left ready for review it will show a congratulations message.

## Creating a new Project/Area note
A good way to quickly create a new Project or Area note is to use the `/np:new` (new note from template) or `/np:qtn` (Quick template note) command from the Templating plugin. Here is what I use as my New Project Template:

```markdown
---
title: Create a new Project note
type: template, quick-note, empty-note, project-note
folder: <select>
---
# <%- prompt('noteTitle', 'Project name') %>
#project @start(<%- promptDate('startDate', 'Enter start date') %>) @due(<%- promptDate('dueDate', 'Enter due date') %>) @review(<%- promptDateInterval('question', 'Enter review interval') %>)
Aim: <%- prompt('aim') %>
Context: <%- prompt('context') %>
```

## "/complete project" command
This adds a `@completed(date)` to the metadata line of the open project note, adds its details to a yearly note in Summaries folder (if the folder exists), and removes the project/area from the review list. It also offers to move it to NotePlan's separate Archive folder.

## "/cancel project" command
This adds a `@cancelled(date)` to the metadata line of the open project note, adds its details to a yearly note in Summaries folder (if the folder exists), and removes the project/area from the review list. It also offers to move it to NotePlan's separate Archive folder.

## "/pause project toggle" command
This is a toggle that adds or removes a `#paused` tag to the metadata line of the open project note. When paused it stops the note being offered with '/next review'. However, it keeps showing it in the review list, so you don't forget about it entirely.

## Configuration
These commands require configuration, which is done by clicking the gear button on the 'Summaries' line in the Plugin Preferences panel.
